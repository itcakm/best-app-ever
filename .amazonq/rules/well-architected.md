This document is organized into top-level Pillars, each of which corresponds to one of the five AWS Well-Architected Framework domains. Under each pillar, rules are listed in order of Priority:

 
## Pillars & Priorities
- **P1** = High Priority (Design Principles)  
- **P2** = Medium Priority (Core Best Practices)  
- **P3** = Low Priority (Additional Guidance)

Each rule appears as a bullet prefixed with its priority code ([P1], [P2], or [P3]) followed by a concise statement. An external tool can parse the Markdown by scanning for headings (## Pillar: …) to identify domains, then reading each list item’s priority tag to classify and prioritize rules.

# AWS Well-Architected Framework Rules

---

## Pillar: Operational Excellence
- **[P1]** Perform operations as code.  
- **[P1]** Make frequent, small, reversible changes.  
- **[P1]** Refine operations procedures frequently.  
- **[P1]** Anticipate and plan for failure.  
- **[P1]** Learn from all operational failures.

- **[P2]** Implement alerts and dashboards for key metrics.  
- **[P2]** Automate responses to known events.  
- **[P2]** Define and review rollback procedures.

- **[P3]** Conduct post-incident reviews and share lessons.  
- **[P3]** Continuously improve runbooks and run-playbooks.

---

## Pillar: Security
- **[P1]** Implement a strong identity foundation (least-privilege IAM).  
- **[P1]** Enable traceability (audit logging, AWS CloudTrail).  
- **[P1]** Apply security at all layers (network, host, application, data).  
- **[P1]** Automate security best practices.  
- **[P1]** Protect data in transit and at rest.  
- **[P1]** Keep people away from data (use services, encryption).

- **[P2]** Implement automated vulnerability scanning.  
- **[P2]** Define incident response plans.

- **[P3]** Regularly rotate keys and certificates.  
- **[P3]** Conduct security training for all teams.

---

## Pillar: Reliability
- **[P1]** Automatically recover from failure (self-healing).  
- **[P1]** Test recovery procedures.  
- **[P1]** Scale horizontally to increase aggregate availability.  
- **[P1]** Stop guessing capacity—use on-demand resources.  
- **[P1]** Manage change in automation.

- **[P2]** Use health checks and graceful shutdowns.  
- **[P2]** Implement multi-AZ and multi-Region architectures.

- **[P3]** Perform game days and fault-injection tests.  
- **[P3]** Maintain a well-defined backup and restore strategy.

---

## Pillar: Performance Efficiency
- **[P1]** Democratize advanced technologies (use managed services).  
- **[P1]** Go global in minutes (leverage AWS Regions/Edge).  
- **[P1]** Use serverless architectures where appropriate.  
- **[P1]** Experiment more often—infrastructure as code.  
- **[P1]** Practice mechanical sympathy (match resources to workload).

- **[P2]** Continuously monitor performance metrics.  
- **[P2]** Right-size instances based on utilization.

- **[P3]** Adopt emerging technologies (machine learning, GPUs).  
- **[P3]** Review and optimize data storage classes.

---

## Pillar: Cost Optimization
- **[P1]** Adopt a consumption-based model.  
- **[P1]** Measure overall efficiency (cost per unit of value).  
- **[P1]** Stop spending on undifferentiated heavy lifting.  
- **[P1]** Analyze and attribute expenditure (cost allocation tags).  
- **[P1]** Use managed and application-level services to reduce cost.

- **[P2]** Implement automated resource shutdown schedules.  
- **[P2]** Purchase Reserved Instances and Savings Plans where justified.

- **[P3]** Leverage spot and preemptible instances.  
- **[P3]** Continuously review unused and idle resources.

---
## Pillar: Sustainability
- **[P1]** Establish and meet sustainability goals; define measurable environmental impact metrics.  
- **[P1]** Integrate sustainability considerations into every architectural decision.  
- **[P1]** Continuously monitor, measure, and report on resource consumption and carbon footprint.

- **[P2]** Right-size and auto-scale resources to minimize idle consumption.  
- **[P2]** Leverage serverless and managed services for higher energy efficiency.  
- **[P2]** Optimize storage classes, data lifecycle, and data transfer to reduce waste.

- **[P3]** Schedule non-critical workloads during periods of lower-carbon energy availability.  
- **[P3]** Decommission or repurpose unused and under-utilized assets.  
- **[P3]** Automate infrastructure lifecycle management for sustained operational efficiency.
